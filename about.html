            I am a shiftee from 4 years of nursing, finding refuge in computer science. And so far,<br>
            I am doing much much better. I like it better here, and I have no plans of leaving.<br>
            <br>
            In the short time I've been exposed to computer science, I have 3 interests in the field namely:
            <ul>
                <li>Image Processing</li>
                <li>Simulations</li>
                <li>Electronics</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            A bit about the website:<br>
            This was a direct result of a 48 hour Copilot assisted hackathon (born from procrastination) to make<br>
            a website from scratch instead of on Google Sites. Although I am quite pleased with how it turned out,<br>
            I didn't really learn a lot about HTML, CSS, and JS, besides a few basic things here and there.<br>
            So if I ever get the chance to remake the website in a future subject, I would do it all manually then.<br>
            <br>
            Also maybe make the home page force you to play a game of breakout to access menu options.
